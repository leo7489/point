Objective:
Add a user points system to a fresh Laravel installation seeded with 5 user accounts.

Deliverables/Requirements:

Create a page with a list of site users and the total (summed) amount of their points.
Be able to add points to users.
Users can have multiple points assigned.
The max amount of points that can be assigned in a single "transaction" is 100. The maximum points a user can have is 500.
Points expire 1 month after creation.
Feature test that loads the page, submits points for a user, and confirms saving to database.

Notes:

Authorization (e.g. roles/permissions/policies) are not needed.
Tests beyond the above requirements are not expected.
Front end is up to you. Does not need to be reactive, but UI/UX should work.
Please limit your time to about two hours. If certain requirements are unable to be met within that time frame, simply document them.
